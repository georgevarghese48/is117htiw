    <p>IP (Internet Protocol) Address is an address of your network hardware. It helps in connecting your computer to other devices on your network and all over the world. An IP Address is made up of numbers or characters. All devices that are connected to an internet connection have a unique IP address which means there’s a need of billions of IP addresses. This requirement is fulfilled by the new IP version IPv6.</p>
    <p>Packets are created when the network breaks an e-mail message into parts of a certain size in bytes. Each packet carries the information that will help it get to its destination -- the sender's IP address, the intended receiver's IP address, something that tells the network how many packets this e-mail message has been broken into and the number of this particular packet. The packets carry the data in the protocols that the Internet uses: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Each packet contains part of the body of your message. A typical packet contains perhaps 1,000 or 1,500 bytes.</p>
    <p>Routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for IP packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.</p>
